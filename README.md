# Self Care Center

## Description
  This is a webpage that randomly generates motivational posters for days when the brain fog comes rolling in a little too thick.

## Usage
  When the page loads, enter your name to access the Self Care Center. On the main page, you will view options for the type of message you want to receive.
  Pick either affirmation or mantra, press the "Receive Message" button and a message in the style of your choice will be revealed. Continue to create randomized messages in that style, or switch to the other style.
